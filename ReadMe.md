#Foundations of Concurrent and Distributed Systems Lab

	Team: Xi Luo, Junyu Pu, Time: July 2014
 
## Description

This lab is to use concurrent programming to solve 5 tasks assigned in the 7th Marathon of Parallel Programming, 2012.

Note: all codes have been successfully compiled and tested. Source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pujunyu/fcd).

##Test Instruction

###Task 1: Bucket Sort
1. Test steps:
	- Go inside the path: `.../task_code/bucket_sort/`
	- Run the Bucketsort_Thread.java code: `.../task_code/bucket_sort$java BucketSort_Thread`
	- Type in the number of cores you want to use for test
(1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 etc), for example: `Please enter the number of cores you want to use: 4`

2. Check result:
	
	The program will print out the results, including number of threads used, time consumed and a message of successfully outputing the result file. The output file Bucketsort.out can be found in current path.

3. Test other input:

	Upload your new test file onto the current path, and change the 29th line code of the BucketSort_Thread.java file: `String[] words = read_file("YourFileName.in");`
	Then re-compile BucketSort_Thread.java and run it again.

### Task 2: Friendly Numbers
 
1. Test steps:
	- Go inside the path: `.../task_code/friendly_numbers/`
	- Run the Friendly_Thread.java code: `.../task_code/friendly_numbers$java Friendly_Thread`
	- Type in the number of cores you want to use for test (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 etc), for example: `Please enter the number of cores you want to use: 4`
	- Type in the range of numbers in which you want to find friendly numbers, for example 1 to 262143:
	```
	Enter the start number: 1
	Enter the end number: 262143
	```

2. Check result:

	The program will print out the results, including number of threads used, time consumed and the number of friendly number pairs found.
	
	Note that the current program is set defaultly to onlyprint out the number of friendly numbers found. If you want to see all the friendly numbers found, simply un-comment the 192nd and 199th lines of code in Friendly_Thread.java, both are the same:
	
	`System.out.println(_all.get(i).getNo() + " and " + _all.get(j).getNo() + " are FRIENDLY");`
	
	But in this case the measured time is not trustable because it also measures the time used for printing.
	
### Task 3: Haar Wavelets

1. Test steps:
	- Go inside the path:
  	`../task_code/haar_transform/`
	- Run c_haar_tran:
  	`./c_haar_tran`
	- Type in the number of cores you want to use for test (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 etc), for example:
  	`Please enter the number of cores you want to use: 4`

2. Check result:
	The program will write the result in image.out file. Use diff to compare with the image.out which calculated by the sequential code.

### Task 4: Unbounded Knapsack

1. Test steps:
	- Go inside the path:
  	`.../task_code/knapsack/`
	- Run the Knapsack_Thread.java code:
  	`.../task_code/knapsack$java Knapsack_Thread`
	- Type in the number of cores you want to use for test (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 etc), for example:
  	`Please enter the number of cores you want to use: 4`

2. Check result:
	The program will print out the results, including number of threads used, the optimized result and time consumed.
 
3. Test other input:
	Upload your new test file onto the current path, and change the 22nd line code of the Knapsack_Thread.java file:
	`Scanner input = new Scanner(new File("YourFileName.in"));` Then re-compile Knapsack_Thread.java and run it again.

### Task 5: 3 SAT

1. Test steps:
	- Go inside the path:
  	`../task_code/3sat`
	- Run the c_3sat.py code:
  	`python c_3sat.py`
	- Type in the number of cores you want to use for test (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 etc), for example:
  	`Number of core: 4`
  	
2. Check result:

	The program will print out the results, including number of threads used, the optimized result and time consumed.
	
	**NOTICE: May return different values due to the solution is no unique.**

## Sample Test Result
	
Tests are conducted on a 8-core server: fcdsrl08.zih.tu-dresden.de
 
### Test cases
	
* Bucket Sort: test file with 2000039 unsorted strings
* Friendly Number: 1 to 262143
* Haar Wavelets: image.in file generated with size 0x800
* Knapsack: test file with the 120 entries
* 3 SAT: 125 clause, 24 values in 3sat.in

### Test Results
**Time consumed in 5 tasks (average of 5 times experiments in ms):**
