PyZmq Devices
===========================

Ã˜MQ  devices are full fledged programs. 
They have an embedded while loop which block execution once invoked.
See `Devices in PyZMQ <http://zeromq.github.com/pyzmq/devices.html>`_.

pyzmq provides convenient classes for launching devices in a background thread or processes.
