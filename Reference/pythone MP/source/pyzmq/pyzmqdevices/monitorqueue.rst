**monitoredqueue.py**

MonitoredQueue allows you to create a Queue device. The messages in/out of the queue are published on a third socket.

MonitoredQueue accepts in/out socket type (type and not socket) like a typical Ã˜MQ device.
It also accepts a third socket types which conveniently can be a zmq.PUB  type. 
This allows the communication on in/out socket to be published on a third socket for monitoring purposes.

Also you should read the following: `pyzmq and unicode <http://zeromq.github.com/pyzmq/unicode.html#what-this-means-for-pyzmq>`_.
As it says, PyZMQ is a wrapper for a C library and you should be passing in bytes and not string which in python 3 would be unicode strings.
We will correct some of our examples later on for this purpose.

This is a simple server that receives a request and sends a reply.

This is a simple client that sends a request, receives and prints the reply.

This is a monitoring client that connects to the publisher socket in the device and publishes the monitoring information.

Here we just start device, server, client and monitoring clients as separate process.  

.. literalinclude:: code/monitoredqueue.py
    :lines: 61-76
